This work is based on Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) and processing data to classify motor imagery in the brain for 2 classes.
An implementation is created based on the BCI Competition IV work done in:
Abdel-Hadi, Mahmoud EA, et al. "Classification of motor imagery tasks with LS-SVM in EEG-based self-paced BCI." Digital Information Processing and Communications (ICDIPC), 2015 Fifth International Conference on. IEEE, 2015.

bciconfig.txt:
This is the configuration file. All the main parameters can be controlled from this file.

bcidataset.py:
This has the class which handles dealing with the BCI Dataset IV file.

preprocessing.py:
It has all the necessary preprocessing required in the algorithm.

processcontrol.py:
It uses all the other classes to drive all the functionality.
